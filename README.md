## 8. SEO Implementation

SEO is crucial for improving the discoverability of your web app. Here’s how we’ve implemented SEO in this app:

1.  **Title and Meta Tags**:
    
    -   The `Helmet` component from `react-helmet` is used to dynamically set the title and meta description of the app.
    
    Example:
    
    ```jsx
    <Helmet>
      <title>Typing Web App</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Interactive typing web app with multiple text styling options." />
    </Helmet>
    
    ```
    
2.  **Accessible Components**:
    
    -   All buttons and controls have proper ARIA labels to enhance accessibility.
    -   Focus states are visible for all interactive elements.

----------

## 9. Dark and Hacker Mode

### **Light and Dark Modes**:

-   **Light Mode**: Default mode with a white background and dark text.
-   **Dark Mode**: Features a dark background with light text for low-light environments.

### **Hacker Mode**:

-   The "Hacker Mode" mimics a terminal environment with a black background, green text, and small font for a retro coding experience.
-   Users can switch to Hacker Mode using the Theme Toggle button.
